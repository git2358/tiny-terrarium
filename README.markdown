# Compilation

To produce the cart image for *tiny terrarium*:

1. Clone this repository where PICO-8 can see it (such as directly under PICO-8's `carts` directory).
2. Open PICO-8.
3. Use the `cd` command to set the working directory to wherever you cloned the repository. (See the manual that came with PICO-8 for instructions.)
4. Enter `load tiny terrarium.p8`.
4. Enter `save tiny terrarium.p8.png`. (Note the additional `.png` on the end.)

After successfully following these steps, you should find the PNG in the repository's directory.
